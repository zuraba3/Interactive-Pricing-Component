## Overview

In this project I mainly needed to focus on page layout, page responsiveness and app functionality.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

4.Create input types.
4.Style all the elements.
5.Create hover effects.
6.Add media queries for responsivnes.
7.Add Javascript code to give webpage functionalities of range, checkbox, count, output responsivelly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained a lot of practise of using Media Queries and create responsive websites. Also it was realy good to practise using more CSS properties like styling input types. With this and other tools I gained a lot of experience and I wrote the CSS code using mobile first approach, that worked eventually and it gave me some confidence and knowledge of making wabsites responsive. The main challenge was to use javascript to give website functionality. I wrote javascript code that calculates monthly ammount and yearly amount depending on bill.

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic, interactive and functional projects
